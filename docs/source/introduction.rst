Overview
========

The ``Remme Protocol`` software introduces a blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling
of decentralized applications. This is achieved by creating an operating system-like construct upon which applications
can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling
of applications across many CPU cores or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that may
ultimately scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment
and maintenance of decentralized applications, in the context of a governed blockchain.

Supported operating systems
===========================

``Remme Protocol`` currently supports the following operating systems:

1. Amazon Linux 2
2. CentOS 7
3. Ubuntu 16.04/18.04
4. MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)
5. Fedora 25 and higher (Fedora 27 recommended)
